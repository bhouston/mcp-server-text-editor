I've created a README.md for the project and would like to suggest some alternative package names before publishing to npm.

## README.md Content

I've added a comprehensive README.md that includes:

- Project description and features
- Supported Claude text editor versions
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples for all commands
- Development setup instructions
- Scripts documentation

## Alternative Package Names

Here are some suggestions for package names:

1. `claude-text-editor-mcp`
2. `claude-editor-tool`
3. `claude-text-tool`
4. `claude-file-editor`
5. `anthropic-text-editor`
6. `anthropic-file-tool`
7. `claude-file-operations`
8. `claude-code-editor`
9. `anthropic-editor-mcp`
10. `claude-editor-server`

The current name `mcp-server-claude-text-editor` is descriptive but quite long. A shorter name might be more user-friendly.

Let me know if you'd like any changes to the README.md or have other package name ideas!
